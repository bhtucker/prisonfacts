#H1 HAFIZBOT
#H3 Sufi Poetry Emailer

HAFIZBOT is a brief Python script that locates poems within a collection of poetry and emails them out simply.
It was designed to work with "Poems from the Divan of Hafiz", a late 19th century translation of the 14th C. Sufi poet.
It's also set up to send out the mails through GMail. 
Another feature that might be fun is determining style based on the content of the line. Since the emails are sent as HTML, inline formatting is easy. There are currently rules for bolding and italicizing based on line content.
